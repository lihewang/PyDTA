# PyDTA
DTA in Python
Macroscopic Dynamic Traffic Assignment
Fast and multiprocessing using Cython, Pandas, and Numpy

This package provides building blocks for DTA model developers who wants to build customized Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) models. Note that this is a macroscopic application of DTA model. It still uses time-delay function to calculate congested link travel time as the static assignment model does. The key feature of this DTA model is the Time Dependent Shortest Path (TDSP). 

Traffic assingment model is known for its computational intensive need mostly because of the shortest path building algorithm.
